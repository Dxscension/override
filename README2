don't bully for bad codin practice lol


if u actually want to run this (obfuscate large scripts)
find a working Lua 5.1 executable (for windows)

if u dont want the script to be terrible change it to run a
luac.exe compiler, not string.dump
I did that for laziness and because I couldn't find, well a luac 5.1 executable.
(no, luajit does not count)
